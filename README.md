# VolounteerHub - An Android application was created with React Native to assist volunteers in finding and participating in different events.

## Introduction

In today's world, young people are increasingly interested in volunteering to
to contribute to society, develop new skills and build
valuable social connections. Yet many potential volunteers
face barriers such as a lack of information about suitable events,
the complexity of registration or the lack of feedback and recognition for their
contribution.

The `VolunteerHub` app addresses these needs and offers a modern solution,
that connects volunteers with event organisers. Thanks to the user-friendly
friendly interface, users can easily search for volunteer
opportunities, register for them and manage their participation history. The motivation behind
to get involved is also the reward system that allows you to earn points
for participating in events and compete in leaderboards with other volunteers.

`VolunteerHub` not only makes it easier to organize and participate in volunteer
events, but it also encourages community building and improves connections between
individuals and organisations. The app contributes to active engagement
young people in society and reinforces the values of cooperation, solidarity and
responsibility.
